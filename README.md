## Project Summary

### Project Context

Happy Commuter by MRT is a mobile responsive web application with an interactive map that allows users to explore bars, restaurants, and gyms located near MRT stations across Singapore.

### Target Audience

The target audience for the app is locals of all ages who need to travel more than two hours round trip every day for work or college. 

The app is also suitable for those who want to explore areas of Singapore that they are not familiar with.

### Justification for the App 

As a full-time employee and now as a full-time student, I am always looking for bars and restaurants where I can hang out with my former colleagues and classmates. Before meeting them, I like to attend the gym in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Thus, the Bugis MRT station has become the central meeting point for us to hang out before heading back home. It divides my travel time in half and makes commuting less boring.

This example could be applied to other MRT locations, depending on where you live, work, and study. The app aims to help everyone find bars, restaurants, and gyms to explore in this beautiful city.

## UX/UI

### Organizational Goals

The app aims to promote local bars, restaurants, and gyms by providing a platform for users to discover them along their commuting journey. Organizations can also notify users of special promotions at their collaborating bars and restaurants.

### User Goals

Users want to know where they can hang out. The app provides the names and locations of bars, restaurants, and gyms near MRT stations. Users can also filter the places they want to go to using checkboxes between bars, restaurants, and gyms.
